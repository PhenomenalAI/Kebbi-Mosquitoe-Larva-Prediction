# Kebbi-Mosquitoe-Larva-Prediction
Build models, that predicts number of moquitoes from geospatial data

The project is centered around building a geospatial model, for predicting larvae breeding sites, using satelite data for wet season.
from the satelites data various geospatial indices such as NDVI, NDMI, LST was computed, from this, potential larva breeding sites was predicted 
and verified by collection of this larvae on the field.
The geospatial model and collection was done for the wet season, there was need for the same to be done on dry season, 
but collection of this larva is rather expensive so machine learning was employed to predict the number of larva in dry season, using the geospatial indices of wet season
as training data to predict for the indices of dry season.
